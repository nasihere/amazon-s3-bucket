Here’s an example of how you can structure a README.md file for your project to provide detailed instructions on how to run the program and extend it in the future.

Python Batch Script with API Calls and Modular Design

This project is a Python-based batch script that can be used to process a list of usernames from an input file, make API calls in batches, and save the results to an output file. It is designed using OOP principles, making it easily extensible for future modules.

Features

	•	Process large lists of usernames in batches and make API calls.
	•	Support for different environments (development, staging, production) via a configuration class.
	•	Modular design using abstract base classes and a factory pattern to support future extensions.
	•	Extensible configuration for API URL, headers, and timeout settings.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You also need the following Python packages:

	•	requests

You can install the required package via pip:

pip install requests

How to Run

	1.	Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.
	2.	Prepare your input file: The input file should contain a list of usernames, one username per line, like so:

Vishal01
Vishal02
Vishal03
...
Vishal100


	3.	Run the program: Use the following command to run the program:

python abc.py "GetUserInfo" --file=Input.txt --output=results.txt --env=dev

Command Parameters:

	•	module: This is the module you want to execute. In this example, we are using the "GetUserInfo" module.
	•	--file: Path to the input file that contains the list of usernames.
	•	--output: Path to the output file where the API results will be saved.
	•	--env: The environment you want to run the script in (dev, staging, or prod). Each environment points to a different API URL as defined in the Config class.

	4.	Example:

python abc.py "GetUserInfo" --file=Input.txt --output=results.txt --env=prod

This command will read usernames from Input.txt, make API calls in batches of 20, and save the results in results.txt using the production API URL.

Project Structure

├── abc.py               # Main script
├── Input.txt            # Input file (contains list of usernames)
├── results.txt          # Output file (generated after running the script)
└── README.md            # Documentation file

Extending the Program

This program is designed to be easily extensible for future modules. Here’s how you can extend it:

1. Add New Modules

To add a new module, follow these steps:

	•	Create a new class that extends the BaseModule abstract class.
	•	Implement the create_payload() method to customize the payload for your new API.
	•	Add your new module to the ModuleFactory so that it can be selected via command line arguments.

Example: Adding a New Module CreateUserModule

class CreateUserModule(BaseModule):
    def create_payload(self, username):
        root = ET.Element("CreateUser")
        user_name = ET.SubElement(root, "Username")
        user_name.text = username
        email = ET.SubElement(root, "Email")
        email.text = f"{username}@example.com"
        return ET.tostring(root, encoding="unicode")

	•	In the ModuleFactory class, add the new module:

class ModuleFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_module(module_name, input_file, output_file, api_client):
        if module_name == "GetUserInfo":
            return GetUserInfoModule(input_file, output_file, api_client)
        elif module_name == "CreateUser":
            return CreateUserModule(input_file, output_file, api_client)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Module {module_name} not recognized.")

Now, you can run the new module as:

python abc.py "CreateUser" --file=Input.txt --output=results.txt --env=prod

2. Modify or Add Configuration for New Environments

The Config class allows you to configure different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod). You can extend or modify the configuration to support additional settings, such as new API URLs, headers, or timeout configurations.

class Config:
    ENV_CONFIG = {
        'dev': {
            "api_url": "https://dev.example.com/xmlrequest.com",
            "timeout": 5,
            "headers": {'Content-Type': 'application/xml'}
        },
        'staging': {
            "api_url": "https://staging.example.com/xmlrequest.com",
            "timeout": 10,
            "headers": {'Content-Type': 'application/xml'}
        },
        'prod': {
            "api_url": "https://prod.example.com/xmlrequest.com",
            "timeout": 15,
            "headers": {'Content-Type': 'application/xml'}
        },
        # Add more environments here
    }

3. Add New API Clients

If in the future, you need to interact with different types of APIs (e.g., REST, SOAP, GraphQL), you can create new clients by extending the APIClient class or creating new classes altogether. For example, if you need to support JSON requests or different authentication mechanisms, you can add the necessary logic here.

Example:

class JSONAPIClient(APIClient):
    def make_post_request(self, payload):
        headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
        response = requests.post(self.api_url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=self.timeout)
        return response.json()  # For JSON responses

4. Advanced Features (Optional)

	•	Error Handling and Logging: Add try-except blocks around the API calls and implement proper logging to track errors and debug issues.
	•	Retries and Timeouts: The APIClient class can be extended to handle retry mechanisms or exponential backoff in case of network issues.
	•	Multi-threading or Async: For large datasets or to speed up the process, you can explore multi-threading or asynchronous API requests.

This setup ensures that the program is flexible, modular, and can be easily extended to handle new requirements as your system evolves.
