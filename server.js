Thanks for sharing the images — based on your Pendo integration code, here’s a complete response and automation strategy you can use to generate similar Pendo setup using Q (your internal AI tool) and respond to Pradeep’s question.

Hi Pradeep,

Yes, that’s definitely feasible! We’ve already abstracted the Pendo logic in a service (AppPendo) and driven it by environment-level flags (like enablePendo and appMode). So we can leverage Q to generate this boilerplate for any component that needs Pendo tracking.

I’ll work on building a prompt that:
	•	Generates the AppPendo service boilerplate,
	•	Injects it into any component,
	•	And scaffolds the appPendo.track('<Label>') line with label customization.

Once that’s ready, we can wrap it up as a reusable prompt or CLI template and share it with other teams.

🔧 How to Automate Pendo Integration using Q

Assuming “Q” is a generative code assistant (like GitHub Copilot, or an internal GPT-based tool), here’s what your prompt/script should describe to Q to generate the full integration:

🧠 Q Prompt Example

Prompt to Q:

“I want to add Pendo tracking to an Angular component. Use the following structure:
	1.	Create a shared injectable service called AppPendo that checks environment flags (appMode, enablePendo) from EnvironmentService.
	2.	Create a track(customLabel: string) function in that service that wraps pendo.track(...), prefixed by INTERNAL or EXTERNAL depending on app mode.
	3.	In any Angular component, inject AppPendo and call this.appPendo.track('<TrackingLabel>') in ngOnInit() or onClick() as needed.
	4.	Skip tracking if isDevModeLocal() is true.

Here’s the example config shape:

params: {
  enablePendo: true
},
appMode: 'external' | 'internal'

💡 Output Q Should Generate
	1.	Service File (pendo.service.ts)
	•	As shown in your first screenshot.
	•	Tracks based on environment and skips in local dev mode.
	2.	Environment Update
	•	Update params.enablePendo: true in the environment.service.ts.
	3.	Component Usage (Auto-inject & call)

constructor(private appPendo: AppPendo) {}
ngOnInit() {
  this.appPendo.track('CreateIntelligenceTopic');
}

Or in a click handler:

onClick() {
  this.appPendo.track('Download');
}

🧩 Making It Reusable for Other Teams

You can wrap this prompt + code structure in a reusable Q template or snippet:
	•	Q command: generate pendo tracking in <component-name> with label '<tracking-label>'
	•	Auto:
	•	Injects the service
	•	Adds the track(...) call
	•	Ensures enablePendo check
	•	Skips in dev mode

If you’d like, I can help you write the exact Q template/script or TypeScript snippet registry so Q can be triggered by a short command. Let me know!
